# Comments in Python start with the hash character.
# A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal.
# A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.

# this is the first comment
name = "Abid Malik"  # and this is the second comment
          # ... Comments can start even in the middle
fullname = "# Abid Munir Malik <-- This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
print(fullname)

#Now let's run our python file
#abidmalik$ python3 Comments.py
# Abid Munir Malik This is not a comment because it's inside quotes.
