# Module 1 Assignment

# 1. Write a program which will find factors of given number and find whether the factor is even or odd
n = input("Enter number to find factorial: ")
n = int(n)
factorials = []
for i in range(1,n+1):
    j = n%i
    if(j == 0):
        factorials.append(i)
print(f"\nFactors of {n}: {factorials}\n")

print("Factors Even or ODD")
for f in factorials:
    if(f%2) == 0:
        print(f"{f} is Even")
    else:
        print(f"{f} is Odd")

# 2. Write a code which accepts a sequence of words as input and prints the words in a sequence after sorting them alphabetically
import sys
words = []
for i in range(1,len(sys.argv)):
    words.append(sys.argv[i])
print(sorted(words))

# 3. Write a program, which will find all the numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma separated sequence on a single line
n1 = 1000
n2 = 3000
even_number_list = []
for i in range(n1,n2+1):
    if(i%2) == 0:
        even_number_list.append(i)
print(f"Even Number list(between 1000-3000): {even_number_list}")

# 4. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits
sentence = input("Enter any sentence: ")
LETTERS,DIGITS = 0,0
for s in sentence:
    if s.isdigit():
        DIGITS += 1
    elif(s.isalpha()):
        LETTERS += 1

print(f"LETTERS: {LETTERS}")
print(f"DIGITS: {DIGITS}")

# 5. Design a code which will find the given number is Palindrome number or not
n = input("Enter any number: ")
# slice[start:end:step]
if (n == n[::-1]):
    print(f"{n} is palindrome")
else:
    print(f"{n} is not palindrome")
