## indentation & spaces
def main(arg):
    if arg == 'batch':
        print(f"running in {arg} mode")
    else:
        print(f"running in standard mode")
        
- TAB are DISCOURGED in Python unless PyCharm, Sublime Text, VS Code is being used
- 4-spaces indentation is preferred for each code block i.e after each loop, function, if, with etc

## VARIABLES
name = 'Abid'
age  =  60
age += 1 # in-line comment

home_address = load_from_database(name)

- No need to TYPE the variable type
- variables can be initialized from a function return value
