## indentation & spaces
def main(arg):

- TAB are DISCOURGED in Python unless PyCharm, Sublime Text, VS Code is being used
- 4-spaces indentation is preferred for each code block i.e after each loop, function, if, with etc

home_address = load_from_database(name)

- No need to TYPE the variable type
- variables can be initialized from a function return value

## TRUTHINESS
False # false is false
[]    # empty lists/arrays are false
{}    # empty dictionaries are false
""    # empty strings are false
0     # zero ints are false
0.0   # zero floats are false
None  # None/null/nil pointers are false

## IF/ELIF/ELSE STATEMENT
cmd = input('Command, [L]ist or E[x]it: ')
if cmd == 'L':
    list_items()
elif cmd == 'x':
    exit()
else:
    print('Sorry, that wasn't understood.')
    
## COMPLEX CONDITIONAL IF STATEMENT
if not x and ( z != 2 or not y):
    # if block code here
Note: Complex conditions are created by using and, or, not

### FOR-IN 
items = ['cat', 'hat', 'mat']
for item in items:
    print(f'item is {item}')
    
for (idx, item) in enumerate(items):
    print(f'{item} is at index {idx});
    
### FUNCTIONS
def create_user(name, email):
    # validate arguments
    db_user = ...
    return db_user.id
    
### FILE I/O
items = ['cat', 'hat', 'mat']
with open(filename, 'w') as fout:
    for item in items:
        fout.write(item + '\n')

### IMPORT MODULES
import os 
OR
from os import path
os.path.exists(filename) # style 1
OR
path.exists(filename) # style 2

### PACKAGES (third party)
- Most of the packages are already included in standard library
- If not, like SQLAlchemy, install them from www.pypi.org
### USING PIP
